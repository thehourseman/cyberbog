                        <p>History of the Internet and History of the World Wide Web
                            In the 1960s, computer scientists began developing systems for time-sharing of computer resources. J. C. R. Licklider proposed the idea of a universal network while working at Bolt Beranek & Newman and, later, leading the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) at the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD). Research into packet switching, one of the fundamental Internet technologies, started in the work of Paul Baran in the early 1960s and, independently, Donald Davies in 1965. After the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in 1967, packet switching from the proposed NPL network was incorporated into the design of the ARPANET, an experimental resource sharing network proposed by ARPA.</p>

                        <h4>information gathering</h4>
                        <p>Information gathering is a process of collecting information from different sources, such as books, websites, interviews, surveys, and more. This process is used to gather information about a particular topic or issue. It helps to create a comprehensive picture of the subject, and is essential for making informed decisions. By gathering information, organizations and individuals can better understand the environment in which they operate, identify potential risks, develop strategies, and make informed decisions. Additionally, information gathering can help to inform public policy and create public awareness on important topics.</p>
